# A Python (PyTorch) Pipeline for Classifying Text Data
This repository contains an example of how an end to end text classification pipeline can be built using PyTorch.

I wrote this code in my early days of learning NLP. 
The techniques in this code are (also, were) undoubtedly obsolete, but back then it was a cool exercise for me to code up an end to end pipeline myself while I was starting to learn.

The code structure is fairly simple so I am skipping adding a description for it.
